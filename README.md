## Background

web3j-libp2p is an implementation of the libp2p modular network stack for the Java virtual machine.

Its goal is to provide a single implementation that meets the needs of Java, Android and Kotlin developers. It is 
written in Kotlin which was designed with Java and Android interop in mind.

The project was created by [Web3 Labs](https://www.web3labs.com) with the support of the 
[Ethereum Community Fund](https://ecf.network) and advisory from members of the libp2p team at 
[Protocol Labs](https://protocol.ai). 


## Getting started

Versioned releases and regular snapshots will be available shortly for the various 
libp2p modules. Until that time, please clone the repo and you can build the artifacts yourself:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/web3j/libp2p.git
cd libp2p
./gradlew build publishToMavenLocal
```


## Contribute

We welcome contributions from everyone.

We are currently prioritising implementation of the libp2p modules that are required for eth2.0's Serenity release. As it currently stands
they are (taken from the following [issue](https://github.com/ethresearch/p2p/issues/4#issuecomment-436702674)):

We recommend before starting work on a contribution that you communicate with the libp2p JVM community on the 
[Gitter](https://gitter.im/web3j/libp2p) channel to express your intent to ensure no-one is already working on it.

Additionally, keep an eye on the open [Pull Requests](https://github.com/web3j/libp2p/issues) and 
[branches](https://github.com/web3j/web3j/branches) to see what others are working on.

Also, please do review the project [issues](https://github.com/web3j/libp2p/issues) to identify any low hanging fruit 
you can get started with!
